# Employee Management System

## About
This is the first university project developed by our team as part of the *Data Structure* course. The project, *Employee Management System*, was completed using C programming and serves as a terminal-based application. It allows users to manage employee records with password-protected features and various functionalities such as adding, viewing, searching, and deleting employee details.

Our team of three members worked together to design and implement this system. We learned a lot about programming, data structures, file handling, and incorporating security features like password protection.
